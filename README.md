**General:**

This is the public release repository of HikingTrails where you can download the latest version of HikingTrails (the sourcecode of HikingTrails resides in a private github repository). HikingTrails is a Windows desktop application for creating and maintaining your walking routes and corresponding photo's.

The main functionalities are as followed:

- Create/edit/delete routes on a Bing Map.
- Create routes in free draw mode or use the routing API (shortest distance/time between two points). Two routing API's are supported: 
open route service API (https://openrouteservice.org/) and the Bing Maps routes API.
- Add points of interests to your route and include a description, tags, a rating and a picture to each point of interest.
- For each route you can (among other things) enter a note, a category, and a date.
- Save your routes as an XML file on your desktop computer/laptop.
- Store as many routes as you want. 
- Export a route/routes to KML and open them in Google Earth. Or you can also use the KML file in an offline navigation app like for example maps.me: (https://support.maps.me/hc/en-us/articles/207895029-How-to-import-bookmarks-). This way you can follow the route on your smartphone while walking.
- Import routes from a KML or GPX file. 
- Import routes from a HikingTrails route file. 
- Import geo-tagged pictures as POI points from a folder (this way you can easily couple your photo's to a location along the hiking trail). 
- Show statistics of your routes.
- View all your routes on a calendar.
- Quickly browse trough the images of all the point of interests of all routes with the use of a treeview.
